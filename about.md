I was born in Barcelona ('82) and moved into [Girona](https://goo.gl/maps/2dL9W7J7LHA2) to study Computer Systems Engineering (ETIS) at the [University of Girona](https://www.udg.edu/ca/), the city where I still live.

Working for [Steema Software](https://www.steema.com/) since 2006; helping customers in the [suppot forums](https://www.steema.com/support), and helping to improve TeeChart, TeeBI and TeeGrid in all their flavours - but specially coding in **Delphi** and **Java** for the charting components.

### Other interests and activities

I like traveling, listening punk-rock and gaming racing&strategy games.
